    "\n",
    "Although AI began with high expectations, its early years were marked by both significant achievements and limitations that revealed the complexity of replicating human intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Development of the First AI Programs**\n",
    "1. **[Logic Theorist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Theorist?utm_source=chatgpt.com)**: Developed by Allen Newell and Herbert Simon, this program could prove mathematical theorems using logical rules. It marked a milestone by demonstrating machines could perform tasks previously considered exclusive to humans.  \n",

    "   - Created by [Joseph Weizenbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum?utm_source=chatgpt.com) in 1966, ELIZA was one of the first programs to simulate human conversation. Using simple pattern-matching rules, it could hold basic dialogues, particularly in simulated psychological therapy sessions.  \n",
    "   - Though ELIZA lacked true language comprehension, its ability to [deceive users](https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-44290222?utm_source=chatgpt.com) into believing they were interacting with a human was groundbreaking.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Early Applications of AI**\n",
    "- **Games like Checkers and Chess**:  \n",
    "  AI was applied early to strategy games. In 1948, Alan Turing developed an early chess program, manually simulated but foundational for future research in this [field](https://www.bigdata.uma.es/los-primeros-programas-de-ia-capaces-de-aprender/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).  \n",

    "## **3. The 1980s to 2000s: Revival and Consolidation**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Rise of Expert Systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1980s marked a pivotal era for artificial intelligence (AI) with the widespread adoption of **[expert systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system)**—rule-based programs designed to emulate human expertise in specialized domains. These systems became the backbone of AI applications in industries such as **medicine, engineering, and business**, revolutionizing decision-making processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In **medicine**, systems like **[MYCIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycin)** and **[DXplain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DXplain)** demonstrated the potential of AI in diagnostics. MYCIN, developed at Stanford University, could identify bacterial infections and recommend antibiotics with 65-70% accuracy, rivaling human specialists. Similarly, DXplain used a knowledge base of diseases to suggest diagnoses based on symptoms. These tools reduced errors and streamlined workflows in healthcare.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In **engineering**, expert systems like **[XCON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCON)** (developed by Digital Equipment Corporation) optimized manufacturing processes by configuring computer components automatically. Meanwhile, **[PROSPECTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospector_(expert_system))** aided geologists in mineral exploration, identifying promising mining sites with 85% accuracy. These applications underscored AI’s ability to handle complex, domain-specific problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **business sector** embraced systems like **[CLIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLIPS)** and **[COADS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COADS)** for tasks ranging from fraud detection to financial forecasting. Banks used AI to assess credit risks, while retailers leveraged it for inventory management. By the late 1980s, the global expert systems market was valued at over $1 billion.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **limitations** soon emerged. Expert systems relied on **manual rule creation**, requiring labor-intensive input from human experts—a bottleneck known as the **[knowledge acquisition problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_engineering)**. They also struggled with adaptability; unlike humans, they couldn’t learn from new data or handle ambiguous scenarios. Critics argued that these systems were merely \"frozen knowledge,\" incapable of evolving. By the 1990s, the hype around expert systems waned, though their legacy influenced later AI developments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advancements in Algorithms and Hardware**\n",
    "\n",
    "While expert systems dominated applications, breakthroughs in **algorithms** and **hardware** laid the groundwork for modern AI. Central to this progress was the resurgence of **[artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)** (ANNs), inspired by the human brain’s structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In 1986, the **[backpropagation algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation)**—pioneered by researchers like **[Geoffrey Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton)**—revolutionized neural network training. Backpropagation allowed networks to adjust their internal parameters by propagating errors backward through layers, enabling them to learn from mistakes. This innovation led to multi-layer networks capable of solving non-linear problems, such as image recognition and speech processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The era also saw theoretical strides in **[deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)**. In 1989, Yann LeCun demonstrated the **[LeNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeNet)** architecture, a convolutional neural network (CNN) that could recognize handwritten digits. Though limited by computational power, these early models proved the viability of deep learning. Researchers like **[Jürgen Schmidhuber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jürgen_Schmidhuber)** explored **[recurrent neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network)** (RNNs), which processed sequential data—a precursor to today’s language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hardware advancements further accelerated AI. The rise of **[parallel processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing)** and specialized chips, like **[GPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit)**, allowed faster computations. By the 1990s, projects like **[Connection Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_Machine)** demonstrated how massive parallelism could tackle AI tasks. These innovations, though underappreciated at the time, set the stage for 21st-century breakthroughs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Major Milestones**\n",
    "\n",
    "Two landmark achievements in the 1990s symbolized AI’s growing prowess: **chess mastery** and **autonomous vehicles**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In 1997, IBM’s **[Deep Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer))** defeated world champion Garry Kasparov in a six-game match. Deep Blue combined brute-force computation (evaluating 200 million positions per second) with strategic heuristics, showcasing AI’s ability to outperform humans in rule-based domains. Though criticized for lacking \"true\" intelligence, Deep Blue’s victory captivated the public and spurred investment in AI research.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Meanwhile, projects like **[ALVINN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALVINN)** (Autonomous Land Vehicle in a Neural Network) pioneered self-driving technology. Developed at Carnegie Mellon University in 1989, ALVINN used a neural network to process camera inputs and steer a vehicle. By 1995, CMU’s **[NavLab 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navlab)** completed a 2,800-mile \"No Hands Across America\" journey, with the system controlling 98% of the steering. These efforts laid the foundation for companies like **[Waymo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waymo)** and **[Tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Other milestones included **[TD-Gammon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD-Gammon)** (1992), a self-taught backgammon program, and **[RAVL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_appearance_model)** (1996), an early facial recognition system. Though these technologies were nascent, they hinted at AI’s future potential in gaming, robotics, and biometrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Legacy of the Era**\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1980s–1990s transformed AI from an academic curiosity into a tool with real-world impact. While expert systems faced decline, they popularized AI in industries and inspired later **[knowledge-based systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge-based_systems)**. Advances in neural networks and hardware, though initially niche, became the bedrock of 21st-century innovations like **[AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo)** and **[ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT)**.
