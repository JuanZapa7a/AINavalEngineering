    "\n",
    "### **Theory (1 hour)**  \n",
    "In this session, we will introduce the fundamental concepts of **[Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)** and its relevance in the field of **naval engineering**. We will explore the following areas:  \n",

    "\n",
    "#### **1. Basic Concepts of AI**  \n",
    "Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and make decisions. AI encompasses several subfields, each with unique applications and methodologies:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **[Machine Learning (ML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)**:  \n",
    "   - A subset of AI that focuses on enabling machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms identify patterns and make predictions based on historical data.  \n",
    "   - Example: Predicting equipment failures based on sensor data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **[Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)**:  \n",
    "   - Inspired by the human brain, ANNs are computational models used for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making.  \n",
    "   - Example: Autonomous navigation systems for ships.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **[Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)**:  \n",
    "   - A branch of AI that enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.  \n",
    "   - Example: Voice-controlled systems for ship operations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Applications of AI in Naval Engineering**  \n",
    "AI is transforming naval engineering by enhancing efficiency, safety, and sustainability. Below are some key applications:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automation**:  \n",
    "   - AI enables the development of autonomous systems for ships, such as self-navigating vessels and automated control systems.  \n",
    "   - Example: **[Autonomous Ships](https://www.marineinsight.com/tech/autonomous-ships-the-future-of-shipping/)** use AI to navigate, avoid obstacles, and optimize routes without human intervention.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Predictive Maintenance**:  \n",
    "   - AI models analyze data from sensors and equipment to predict potential failures before they occur. This reduces downtime and maintenance costs.  \n",
    "   - Example: Using **[Machine Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/predictive-maintenance-using-machine-learning-2b8d6b02e5a4)** to monitor engine performance and detect anomalies in real-time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Route Optimization**:  \n",
    "   - AI algorithms optimize shipping routes by considering factors like weather conditions, fuel consumption, and delivery schedules.  \n",
    "   - Example: **[AI-powered route planning](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/internet-of-things/iot-maritime-route-optimization/)** minimizes fuel usage and reduces environmental impact.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Analysis**:  \n",
    "   - Ships generate vast amounts of data from sensors, navigation systems, and operational logs. AI processes this data to provide actionable insights.  \n",
    "   - Example: Real-time monitoring of ship performance using **[Big Data Analytics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/big-data-analytics)**.  \n",
    "\n",

    "### **Practice (5 hours)**  \n",
    "In this hands-on session, students will set up a working environment for AI development and gain familiarity with essential tools.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Setting Up the Work Environment**  \n",
    "To begin working on AI projects, you need to configure a development environment with the following tools:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**:  \n",
